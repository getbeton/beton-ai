# PRD 2.x: OpenAI Integration Series

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents for implementing OpenAI integration capabilities in the platform.

## Overview

The PRD 2.x series focuses on adding OpenAI integration to complement the existing Apollo integration framework. This enables users to leverage OpenAI's powerful language models for content generation, data analysis, and AI-powered business insights.

## Documents in this Series

### 2.1: Add OpenAI Integration Service
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 weeks

Core OpenAI integration service following the existing Apollo integration patterns. Includes:
- API key validation and health checks
- Integration CRUD operations
- Service factory pattern integration
- Basic text generation capabilities
- Usage tracking and cost monitoring

**Dependencies:** None  
**Target Release:** Version 2.1.0

## Architecture Alignment

This series builds upon the existing integration framework:
- **Service Factory Pattern**: Extends existing ServiceFactory for OpenAI
- **Database Schema**: Reuses existing Integration, ApiKey, and PlatformApiKey models
- **API Patterns**: Follows established REST API conventions
- **Frontend Components**: Integrates with existing integration management UI

## Key Benefits

1. **Unified Integration Management**: OpenAI integrations managed alongside Apollo integrations
2. **Minimal Development Overhead**: Leverages existing patterns and infrastructure
3. **Secure API Key Management**: Supports both personal and platform API keys
4. **Usage Monitoring**: Built-in token tracking and cost estimation
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for future AI service integrations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Service (Week 1)
- OpenAIService implementation
- ServiceFactory integration
- Basic health check functionality

### Phase 2: Integration Management (Week 2)
- CRUD operations for OpenAI integrations
- API key validation endpoints
- Frontend integration forms

### Phase 3: Basic Operations (Week 3)
- Text generation functionality
- Usage tracking and metrics
- Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 4: UI/UX Polish (Week 4)
- Integration management interface
- Usage dashboards
- Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 5)
- Full testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## Future Roadmap

Potential future PRDs in this series:
- **2.2**: Advanced OpenAI Operations (embeddings, fine-tuning)
- **2.3**: OpenAI Assistant API Integration
- **2.4**: Batch Processing and Automation
- **2.5**: Custom Prompt Templates and Libraries

## Technical Specifications

### Key Technologies
- **OpenAI API v4**: Latest OpenAI JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation
- **Existing Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, React, Prisma

### Environment Requirements
- OpenAI API key (personal or platform)
- Existing database schema (no new tables required)
- Current authentication and authorization system

## Success Metrics

- Number of OpenAI integrations created
- API key validation success rate (>95%)
- Average response time (<3 seconds)
- Token usage tracking accuracy (100%)
- User satisfaction with OpenAI features
- System uptime and reliability (>99.9%)

## Documentation

Each PRD includes:
- Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications and API endpoints
- Database schema requirements
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Testing strategies

## Getting Started

1. Review PRD 2.1 for complete implementation details
2. Ensure development environment meets requirements
3. Follow the 5-phase implementation strategy
4. Implement comprehensive testing at each phase
5. Deploy with proper monitoring and alerting

## Notes

- **No Mock Service**: Unlike Apollo, OpenAI integration does not require a mock service
- **Cost Monitoring**: OpenAI API usage incurs costs - implement proper tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI has rate limits - implement appropriate retry logic
- **Security**: API keys must be encrypted and never exposed client-side
- **Compliance**: Ensure content filtering and appropriate use policies
