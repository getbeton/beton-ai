# Commit 5.2: Documentation and Cleanup

## Goal
Clean up code and document changes

## Dependencies
- Commit 5.1: Comprehensive testing and bug fixes

## Files Modified
- Code cleanup throughout
- README updates if needed

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Code Cleanup
1. Remove console.log statements and debug code
2. Clean up unused imports and dead code
3. Remove temporary files and backup code
4. Optimize imports for better tree shaking

### Step 2: Code Quality
1. Ensure code comments are helpful and accurate
2. Verify consistent code formatting
3. Check TypeScript types are properly defined
4. Ensure error handling is comprehensive

### Step 3: Documentation Updates
1. Update README if CSV upload functionality documented
2. Add code comments for complex logic
3. Document new component interfaces
4. Update any API documentation if needed

### Step 4: Component Standards
1. Verify all new components follow existing patterns
2. Check prop interfaces are well-defined
3. Ensure accessibility attributes are present
4. Verify responsive design implementation

### Step 5: Production Readiness
1. Environment variables properly configured
2. Build process works without warnings
3. No development-only code in production build
4. Performance optimizations applied

### Step 6: Final Review
1. Code review for style and convention adherence
2. Security review for file upload handling
3. Performance review for large data sets
4. Accessibility compliance verification
