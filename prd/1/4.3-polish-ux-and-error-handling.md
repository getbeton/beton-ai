# Commit 4.3: Polish UX and Error Handling

## Goal
Ensure smooth user experience with proper error handling

## Dependencies
- All previous commits

## Files Modified
- Multiple components for error handling consistency
- `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` (error handling utilities)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Audit Error Messages
1. Review all error messages for consistency
2. Ensure user-friendly language (no technical jargon)
3. Provide actionable guidance in error messages
4. Match existing toast notification patterns

### Step 2: Implement Loading States
1. Loading states throughout upload process
2. Skeleton loading for table cards during fetch
3. Button loading states during actions
4. Progress indicators for long operations

### Step 3: Add Optimistic UI Updates
1. Immediate feedback for user actions
2. Optimistic table updates before API confirmation
3. Rollback on API failures
4. Smooth transitions between states

### Step 4: Error Recovery Flows
1. Retry mechanisms for failed operations
2. Clear instructions for resolving errors
3. Fallback options when primary flow fails
4. Graceful degradation for network issues

### Step 5: Success Notifications
1. Success messages that match existing patterns
2. Contextual actions in success notifications
3. Appropriate timing for notification dismissal
4. Celebration animations for major actions

### Step 6: Edge Case Handling
1. Empty states for search results
2. Offline behavior
3. Slow network conditions
4. Large file handling

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Loading Feedback**: Loading states provide clear feedback
✅ **Error Recovery**: Error recovery flows help users resolve issues
