## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: End-to-End Testing
1. Complete user flow testing from login to table creation
2. CSV upload → table creation → table management flow
3. Empty state → populated state transitions
4. All error scenarios and recovery flows

### Step 2: Cross-Browser Compatibility
1. Test in Chrome (latest)
2. Test in Firefox (latest)
3. Test in Safari (latest)
4. Test in Edge (latest)
5. Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Step 3: Responsive Design Testing

2. Tablet devices (768px - 1024px)
3. Desktop devices (1024px+)
4. Ultra-wide displays (1440px+)

### Step 4: Performance Testing
1. Dashboard with 1 table vs 100+ tables
2. Large CSV file upload performance
3. WebSocket connection handling under load
4. Memory leak detection during long sessions

### Step 5: Accessibility Testing
1. Keyboard navigation through all features
2. Screen reader compatibility
3. Color contrast verification
4. Focus management during uploads

### Step 6: Bug Fixes
1. Fix any bugs discovered during testing
2. Optimize performance bottlenecks
3. Resolve cross-browser compatibility issues
4. Address accessibility violations
