# 🚀 Getting Started with the Knowledge Hub

Welcome to the team! This repository serves as the central "brain" for our company's collective knowledge.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

All you need is the **Antigravity** application installed on your machine.

* **Antigravity** handles the technical "plumbing" (Git, Markdown formatting, file management) so you can focus on the content.

## 📥 Step 1: Accessing the Library ("Cloning")

In technical terms, downloading the repository is called "Cloning". Think of it as syncing the entire library to your laptop so you can work offline or online.

1. **Open Antigravity**.
2. Select **"Clone Repository"** from the welcome screen or command menu.
3. Choose **"Beton"** (matches our company name) from the list.
4. Select a safe folder on your computer to store these documents (e.g., your `Documents` folder).

*Result: You now have a local copy of every strategy deck, meeting note, and policy on your machine.*

## 🧭 Step 2: Navigating

You don't need to hunt through folders manually if you don't want to. You can simply ask Antigravity:
> *"Open the Engineering Department folder"*
> *"Where are the HR policies?"*

However, if you prefer to browse, the structure is logical:

* **`departments/`**: Specific workspaces for each function.
* **`projects/`**: Cross-functional initiatives.
* **`docs/`**: Guides like this one.

## ✍️ Step 3: Making Changes

When you want to edit a document or create a new one:

1. **Open the file** in Antigravity.
2. **Type your changes**.
3. **Ask Antigravity to save**: You can simply say *"Save this and push the changes for me"*.

### Key Concepts for Consultants

* **Local vs. Remote**: You work on your "Local" copy. No one sees it until you "Push" it to the "Remote" (Cloud).
* **Commit**: This is just a "Save Point". It requires a short message (e.g., "Updated Q3 projections") so we have a history of *why* changes were made.
* **Push**: This "Publishes" your saved changes to the rest of the team.
* **Pull**: This "Refreshes" your library to get the latest work from your colleagues. **Always Pull before you start working!**

## 🆘 Need Help?

Just ask the agent!
> *"How do I create a new table in this document?"*
> *"Fix the formatting on this list for me."*
